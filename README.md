# Experiment-based detection of service disruption attacks in optical networks using data analytics and unsupervised learning

This is the source code developed to generate the results reported in the paper: M. Furdek, C. Natalino, M. Schiano and A. Di Giglio, `Experiment-based detection of service disruption attacks in optical networks using data analytics and unsupervised learning,` presented at the SPIE Photonics West Conference, 2019 (preprint available [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330799002_Experiment-based_detection_of_service_disruption_attacks_in_optical_networks_using_data_analytics_and_unsupervised_learning)).

In this work, we adopt an experimental, data-analytic approach to explore a dataset of optical network attacks firstly presented [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329392330_Field_Demonstration_of_Machine-Learning-Aided_Detection_and_Identification_of_Jamming_Attacks_in_Optical_Networks).
